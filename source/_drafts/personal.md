Can you pinpoint the exact moment when a career you love becomes a prison you built yourself?

Mine happened at 2 AM in a hospital room, holding my four-month-old son while waiting for him to sleep to get an MRI.

Hours earlier, consumed by my supervisor's "urgent" demands about a paper that would only be published another seven years later, I was frenetically jumping between my laptop and the sofa where my baby lay. In that silly dance of academic pressure, my son had fallen to the ground. Sitting in that hospital, I experienced what Daniel Kahneman might call a System 1 override of System 2 thinking. That visceral, immediate knowing that cuts through all our careful rationalizations. No amount of prestige, no publication in Nature or Science, no promise of my own lab could justify what happened. The academic path I devoted ten years of my life was just ending.

But what surprised me most: I felt no fear about leaving. Only relief. Pure, crystalline relief.

## The lab is a small startups in a medieval suit

Let me share something counterintuitive about academic research that most people do not realize: scientific laboratories are actually nimble startups trapped in feudal power structures. Think about it. In my immunology lab, we operated with:

- Teams of 8-10 people (classic startup size)
- Rapid iteration cycles (experiment, fail, pivot, repeat)
- Constant innovation and problem-solving
- International, diverse talent pools
- Meritocratic ideals (in theory)
- Passionate people working insane hours for a mission they believe in

This should be a recipe for thriving, creative work. And sometimes, in those magical moments when you are deep in an experiment, surrounded by brilliant colleagues from around the world, all chasing the same elegant solution to a biological puzzle: it absolutely is. The scientific method itself is inherently agile. As Olivier Sibony points out in "Noise", good decision-making systems require both the ability to recognize patterns (what scientists excel at) and the humility to acknowledge when those patterns mislead us (what the scientific method enforces through experimentation). We are trained to fail fast, iterate quickly, and let data override ego.

So what goes wrong?

## What I would call "the prestige trap"

>Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it.

Academia has weaponized this quote from Daniel Kahneman into an entire culture. In academia, people created a system where every decision gets filtered through a single metric: publication impact factor. It is a beautiful example of what is recognized as both bias (systematic deviation toward prestige) and noise (random variations in how that prestige gets evaluated). Your entire worth—funding, career progression, peer respect collapses into where you publish. This creates what I now recognize as a cascading series of poor decisions:

- You have invested years in specialized training
- Your identity becomes entangled with your academic title
- You optimize for metrics rather than meaning
- You tolerate increasingly toxic behavior because "that's how academia works"
- You sacrifice everything else, family, health, financial stability—for the possibility of academic success

>[Recent Nature surveys reveal the outcome](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02450-9): 28% of postdocs report moderate to severe depression, with rates of anxiety and depression six times higher than the general population. That is not a bug in the system. It is the predictable output of a machine designed to extract maximum intellectual labor for minimum security. But the very skills that make you excellent at science make you terrible at recognizing when science is altering you.

## The failure advantage

When I started learning to code after leaving my postdoc, something felt very familiar. Not the syntax or the logic structures, but the rhythm of the work itself.

>Debug, test, fail. Refactor, test, fail. Research, implement, fail differently.

Then it hit me: I have been training for this my entire academic career. In immunology research, failure is the default state. Your experiments fail 95% of the time. Your antibodies do not bind, your cells die mysteriously, your perfectly designed protocol produces noise instead of signal. You develop what I now think of as "failure fluency". It is the ability to maintain curiosity and momentum when nothing works as expected. Most people entering tech from traditional backgrounds have to learn this comfort with failure. They have been optimized for getting things right the first time, for following established procedures to predictable outcomes.

But scientists? We have been cooked by failure for years. We have developed what is called a "growth mindset" not through corporate training workshops but through daily necessity. I think this turned out to be my secret weapon. When my code did not compile (aaaah scala), when my data pipeline leaked memory, when my machine learning model produced garbage, I did not panic. I did what I always did: formed hypotheses, designed experiments, gathered data, iterated. The medium had changed from proteins to code, but the "meta-skill" remained identical.

## What really defines you

>Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?

This quote from Mary Oliver's poem stroke me back in the days. What will I do since I was not "Dr. Faouzi Braza, the immunologist" anymore. And here is something we do not talk enough in career transitions: the identity vertigo is real, and it is profound.

I was still a father, still a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner, still someone who loved drawing, playing video games and traveling. Yet for academia I became something worse than a failure. I was irrelevant. To family and friends, I had somehow diminished, as if those ten years of research had evaporated the moment I stopped pipetting. This is the "[identity foreclosure](https://dictionary.apa.org/identity-foreclosure)". It happens when we commit to an identity without exploring alternatives. Academia does not just encourage this; it demands it. You are not just doing science; you ARE a scientist. But there is some liberating truth: **competences are portable, identity is flexible**.

A friend put it perfectly: "Faouzi, you are not a scientist. You are a scholar." That subtle shift changed everything. A scientist is a job title, confined to laboratories and grant applications. A scholar is a way of being in the world endlessly curious, rigorous in thinking, committed to understanding. You can be a scholar while writing code, building data pipelines, or developing policy recommendations. In other words, I did not leave science. I took the scientific method with me and decided to apply it to new domains.

## The consultancy paradox

My journey through tech revealed a fascinating dichotomy that exists everywhere but becomes stark in consulting: the difference between performing competence and possessing it. At Adaltas, my first tech role as an intern, I watched David Worms and his small team of genuine experts manage massive Kubernetes clusters and cloud infrastructures for major French corporations. They competed successfully against consultancies ten times their size. How? They prioritized craft over theater.

But at my next role I encountered the opposite. Despite being surrounded by brilliant people, the business model demanded performance over substance. The CEO, phenomenal at sales, clueless about software development, had sold contracts that did not include time for testing. I was literally told not to write unit tests for a microbiome analysis solution because "testing was not in the contract." Think about the absurdity: software that might influence medical decisions, built without basic quality assurance, because someone who had never written code decided testing was optional.

The worst moment came during a Big Pharma placement. My manager's advice still haunts me: "You cannot say 'I do not know.'" So there I was, performing about cloud engineering concepts I did not master, watching confusion dawn in the client's eyes as they realized I was bluffing. That shame I felt was massive. The pressure to appear competent often prevents you from becoming competent.

## When Everything clicked at Sunrise

After thirteen months of consultancy, a recruiter reached out about something different: a machine learning engineer role at Sunrise, a startup developing AI for sleep apnea diagnosis. The first person I spoke with was [Cyril Le Mat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyrillemat/), their data and software lead: an engineer with a solid track record of shipping ML models in production. Funny fact. This was the first time I acutally had a real technical interview.

Let that sink in.

After dozens of interviews with companies desperately claiming they needed data engineers and ML specialists, Sunrise was the first to actually test whether I could do the work or let put it differently, whether I had the needed skills to learn, iterate and ship. Everyone else had been satisfied with resume keywords and performative conversations about my "passion for data." Cyril wanted to know if I could actually write code and think about it. The interview went great even though I was not able to answer all the questions. But more importantly, it set the tone for everything that followed. This was a place where competence mattered more than credentials, where building mattered more than talking about building. When I joined, they were running their diagnostic model on a local computer. A brilliant algorithm trapped in a laptop. Everything needed to be built: cloud infrastructure, data pipelines, model optimization, deployment systems.

This was what I had been searching for without knowing it. The startup energy I enjoyed in academic labs but without the feudal overlords. Fast-paced problem-solving where my ideas mattered, where I could contribute directly to the codebase, where learning was not just tolerated but essential. Every day brought new challenges with Google Cloud, new patterns to implement, new systems to design. Cyril became the mentor and colleague I needed all along. Someone who combined technical excellence with human decency, who could teach without condescending, who saw potential and nurtured it rather than exploiting it. Their entire dev team operated this way under the guidance of **NAME HERE**. We were building something meaningful together, and everyone's contribution mattered. For thirtheen months, I thrived. I found my confidence not through external validation but through code that worked, systems that scaled, problems that got solved. This was not imposter syndrome territory. This was genuine competence being built line by line, deployment by deployment.

Then came the day that taught me another crucial lesson about modern careers.

## The startup reality check

>We have nothing negative to say about your work performance or anything else. The company is shifting.

Out of twenty people, eight of us were let go that day. Including me. The company was pivoting from B2B diagnostic technology to an online sleep clinic after their acquisition of Dreem. A completely valid business decision that just happened to make my role redundant. The conversation with Cyril and HR felt surreal in its kindness. No performance issues, no complaints about my work, no dramatic failure. Just a strategic shift. They were genuinely sorry. I was genuinely devastated.

What hurt most was not the job loss. I understood that startups pivot, that this is part of the game. What crushed me was that they could not envision me contributing to the new direction. Here I was, someone who had transformed from immunologist to data engineer to ML engineer, and somehow I had become fixed in their minds as just the cloud and machine learning infrastructure guy. **The very adaptability that got me here had become invisible**.

But despite the deception, Sunrise taught me what I actually wanted from work:

- Technical challenges that matter
- Teams that value competence over theater
- Learning as a core activity, not a guilty pleasure
- The ability to see my impact directly in the code and systems I build
- Mentors who teach through collaboration rather than hierarchy

The layoff hurted precisely because Sunrise had given me all of these things. You cannot mourn the loss of something you never valued. The pain was proof that I found something worth finding, even if I could not keep it.

## My corporate interlude at AXA

After being laid off, I felt the familiar pressure that every homeowner with a mortgage knows too well. You know the drill. Bills do not pause for career transitions, and the freedom to grocery shop without mental arithmetic is, for me, the ultimate luxury. I do not care about fancy cars or any other fancy furnitures. I just want to live without the constant hum of financial anxiety. And in Belgium, maintaining that baseline requires a steady salary. So when a contractor offer at AXA Belgium came up, I took it. The team specialized in AI and analytics and filled again with talented people working within a very different organizational rhythm than I experienced at Sunrise. We considered ourselves agile, and compared to the main software teams, we actually were. I remember sitting through one of their presentations about CI/CD implementation. Coming from Sunrise where we deployed multiple times daily, the contrast was striking—here, deployments were measured in days, not hours. It was simply a different world with different priorities.

But AXA offered something I had not experienced in years: stability and breathing room. No one breathing down your neck, no impossible deadlines, no existential threats to the company's survival. After the intensity of startup life, this was a different kind of professional experience entirely. I noticed some of my colleagues, brilliant data scientists with PhDs and impressive publication records, had found creative ways to maintain their technical edge. They discovered a balance that worked for them: the security of a stable position combined with the intellectual stimulation of side projects. Everyone finds their own equation for professional satisfaction.

This experience taught me something valuable about organizational diversity. Large companies do not innovate the same way startups do, and that is not necessarily a failure: it is a feature. AXA needed to keep their existing business sustainable, serving millions of customers reliably. Their innovation might come from a new process optimization, a marketing campaign refinement, or a regulatory compliance improvement. Not from implementing the latest Python library for shipping the last LLM. These are equally valid forms of progress, just operating on different timescales and risk profiles. For me personally, I discovered that this particular rhythm was not quite right. I found myself missing the immediate feedback loops of startup development, the daily problem-solving that had energized me at Sunrise.

It was not that AXA was wrong. It was perfect for many of my colleagues who thrived in that environment. It simply helped me understand more clearly what kind of work environment brought out my best. And as my contract neared its end, I started looking for the next role with clearer self-knowledge. I interviewed for various tech positions, now better able to articulate what I was seeking: a place where I could tackle unconventional problems that needed creative software solutions, where the pace matched my own internal rhythm.

## An interesitng detour in a think tank

But things not always go as you expect. During my job search, a peculiar job offer caught my attention: a think tank looking for someone with experience as a biologist, knowledge of AI, and interest in European policy. The improbability of this combination made me laugh. It was as if someone had been watching my career and designed a role specifically for my weird trajectory. The interview with my future director clicked immediately. She has been a scientist herself, then worked at WHO and the United Nations, even served as deputy minister in her home country. She saw in me not just the biologist or the engineer, but the synthesis of both: someone who could translate between the languages of science, technology, and policy. For eight stellar months, I experienced what work could be when everything aligns. We dove deep into biosecurity challenges, explored the bioeconomy's potential, stood at the intersection of AI and biotech trying to help policymakers understand implications they could barely imagine. This was not just intellectually stimulating; it felt important. My manager's leadership style was transformative: she assumed competence, encouraged exploration, and created psychological safety that allowed real innovation.

Then leadership changed, and with it, everything else.

The transformation triggered every warning signal I learnt to recognize. Processes multiplied overnight. The new vertical approach replaced the culture that had drawn me in. I watched the organization shift into what I can only describe as being very corporate: lots of movement and lots of meetings. But what unsettled me most was recognizing a familiar pattern from academia: the prestige trap, just wearing different clothes. The Brussels bubble, as insiders call it, is its own ecosystem where proximity to European institutions becomes its own form of currency. Some colleagues genuinely thrived in this environment. They found meaning in navigating these political dynamics, in being part of this influential circle. For them, this was exactly where they wanted to be.

For me, it felt somehow like being back in the academic circuit. A recursive loop where we were writing reports for people who would use them to write their own reports, increasingly distant from any real-world implementation. The environment had become deeply political despite our "apolitical" label, and I found myself again optimizing for the wrong things. I could feel myself slipping back into patterns I worked hard to escape. Performing expertise rather than developing it, valuing institutional proximity over problem-solving, getting caught up in organizational processes rather than focusing on substance. The same toxic hints I saw in academia were reforming around me, just with different acronyms and a more polished environment.

This was not about the think tank being wrong. It was about me recognizing I was in the wrong place. The very things that made others feel important and connected made me feel trapped and disconnected. Where they saw opportunity to influence policy, I saw distance from tangible impact. Where they found satisfaction in high-level strategy, I craved the direct feedback loops of building and implementation. I made a decision that my younger self would have found inconceivable: I decided to quit. No backup plan, no next role lined up. By the time you read this, I will have submitted my resignation, effective September 19th, 2025. Not because the work does not matter, it matters enormously. But because I learnt to recognize when an environment activates my worst professional instincts, when I am being pulled back into patterns that strongly impacted me once before.

Sometimes the bravest thing is to admit that you do not belong, even when everyone else seems to be thriving.

## Lessons learned

After this journey through academia, consultancies, startups, corporations, and think tanks, I have developed a clear picture of what I expect versus what I would like to avoid. The patterns are surprisingly consistent across domains.

### What I need:

- The environments where I thrived most shared certain characteristics. They were places where building mattered more than talking about building. Where you could see the direct impact of your work, not filtered through layers of abstraction or organizational procedures. Where technical decisions were made by the people actually doing the technical work, not by those selling it or managing it from a distance.
- I discovered I need radical transparency. Not the corporate kind where "transparency" means carefully curated information, but the real kind where you can see how decisions are made, where money goes, what projects are actually about. The secrecy and information hoarding I encountered, whether in academia or corporate organisations, creates the very dysfunction it claims to prevent.
- I need environments that treat learning as a core activity, not a guilty pleasure you squeeze in after hours. The places that killed my spirit were those where growth was seen as a threat to billable hours or where staying in your lane was valued over expanding your capabilities. Give me a place that says "we do not know what we do not know yet" over one that pretends to have all the answers.

### The death of artificial metrics:

- A lot of environments I evolved in were obsessed with the what I think to be the wrong metrics. Academia's impact factors. Consultancies' billable hours. Corporations' quarterly targets. Policy world's proximity to power. These metrics become ends in themselves, divorced from any actual value creation. I personally think that once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. What I am looking for instead are places that measure what matters: Does the code work? Does it solve a real problem? Are we learning? Are we building something we are proud of? These are not metrics you can game or perform: they are either true or they are not.

### Small teams, big impact:

- The best experience I had were in small, autonomous teams. Whether in a lab, at Sunrise, or during those first months at CFG. There's something magical about having 5-10 people aligned on a goal, each bringing different skills, all able to see their direct contribution to the outcome. Large organizations try to recreate this with "agile" methodologies, but you cannot fake the intimacy and accountability of a genuinely small team.

### Trust over surveillance:

- The organizations that demanded timesheets, constant status updates or sterile performance were invariably the ones I felt were producing the least actual value. It is a paradox that seems to escape most management: the more you try to measure and control productivity, the less productive people become. They optimize for looking busy rather than being effective.
- What I am seeking are environments built on trust. Environments where if you hire people and give them interesting problems, you do not need to watch them every minute. Where the assumption is that people want to do good work, not that they are trying to slack off. Where flexibility, in when and how you work, is seen as treating adults like adults, not as a privilege to be earned.

## What comes next

As I prepare to leave CFG, I am also realising that **I missed coding and engineering a LOT**. I missed the problem solving, the implemetnation of meanigful software or data products. But most importantly, I am not looking for the perfect organization. I look for one that is consciously imperfect but learning. One that admits it does not have everything figured out but is committed to figuring it out together.

I want to work somewhere that values:

- Craftsmanship over credentials, where the quality of what you build matters more than where you studied or the image you reflect to others
- Transparency over hierarchy, where information flows freely and decisions are made by those closest to the work
- Learning over knowing, where "I do not know, let's find out" is valued over false expertise
- Building over performing, where shipping working solutions beats slide presentations
- Individual quirks over corporate conformity, where different working styles are seen as strength, not deviation
- Sustainable pace over heroic sprints, where work-life balance is not just a slogan but an operational reality

These are not utopian demands. I saw glimpses of all of them in different places. At Adaltas with David's technical mentorship. At Sunrise with Cyril's collaborative leadership. In those early months at CFG when we were genuinely exploring important problems. Even in academia's best moments, when the joy of discovery overshadowed the institutional dysfunction. What's different now is that I know these are not just nice-to-haves. They are prerequisites for me to do meaningful work. I learnt that I can survive in environments that lack them, but survival is not the goal. The goal is to grow and learn. The goal is to contribute to environments where excellence and humanity reinforce each other rather than compete.
